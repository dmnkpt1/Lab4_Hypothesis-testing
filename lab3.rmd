**Work breakdown**

-   Task 1:

-   Task 2:

-   Task 3:

-   Task 4:

Data was generated as:

## Problem 1

$$
H_o : \mu\_1 = \mu\_2 \ \text{vs.} \  H_1 : \mu\_1 \ne \mu\_2;\  \sigma^2_1 = \sigma^2_2 = 1
$$

```{r}


```

## Problem 2

$$
H_o : \sigma_1 = \sigma_2 \ \text{vs.}\  H_1 : \sigma_1 > \sigma_2 \ \mu_1 = \mu_2 \ is \ known
$$

```{r}

```

## Problem 3. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test

a.  $\{x_k\}^{100}_{k=1}$ are normally distributed (with parameters calculated from the sample)

b.  $\{|x_k|\}^{100}_{k=1}$ are normally distributed (with parameters calculated from the sample)

c.  $\{x_k\}^{100}_{k=1}$ are normally distributed (with parameters calculated from the sample)

## Problem 4
